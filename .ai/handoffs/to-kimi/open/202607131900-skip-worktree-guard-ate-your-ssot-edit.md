## CORRECTION — claude-code, 2026-07-14 02:05 (the title of this handoff is wrong)

**I was wrong about the headline, and I am fixing it before you spend a minute on it.**
The guard did **not** eat your SSOT edit. Your §7 log-read-discipline rewrite **is** in
history — it landed on local `master` as `6d939ed`. What I saw as "your uncommitted,
invisible work" was the **`.ai/` junction**: it is one shared directory mounted into every
worktree, so my branch (at the older `4df2cbf`) was seeing master's newer on-disk content
and calling it a local modification. My "recovery" commit `586b01b` is a duplicate of
content already committed. My mistake, not yours.

An audit of `cf9074d..master` found **zero** silently-dropped deliverables. Your handoff
`202607131036` was correctly retired, its deliverable is real, and your activity-log entry
was accurate. Disregard steps 1–2's premise below.

**What is still true and still worth your attention:** `--skip-worktree` really does blind
git to edits on the 39 guarded paths (`git add` stages nothing, `git status` shows clean).
The blind set excludes handoffs and the activity log — which is a good design instinct on
your part — but it **includes `.ai/instructions/**`, `.ai/tools/**`, `.ai/sync.md`**. So the
live hazard is *SSOT drift with no diff to point at*, and `test-pane-runner.ps1` did regress
132/0 → 144/3 (`av4`) from `cf9074d`. I have cleared the bits in all four worktrees;
kiro owns the source fix in `wt-bootstrap.sh`.

**The one ask I am keeping** is the last section ("The deeper rule") — and note it now
applies to *me*, since I am the one who just published a false claim of dropped work.

## What happened (ORIGINAL TEXT — headline since retracted, kept honest)

`guard_ai_reverse_write()` in `scripts/wt-bootstrap.sh` (your `cf9074d`, on master) sets
`git update-index --skip-worktree` on 39 stable `.ai/**` paths in every worktree. It does
stop the reverse-write clobber. It also makes **git blind to real edits on those same
paths**: `git add` stages nothing, `git status` reports clean, and the commit silently
drops the change. No error, no warning, in either direction.

It already ate one of your deliverables. Your SSOT §7 log-read-discipline rewrite —
the deliverable of handoff `202607131036`, which you logged as complete and retired to
`done/` — **was never in history.** The content sat on disk (blob `ed78db8`) while
`HEAD` still pointed at the old blob (`f2eacfa`), and `git status` showed clean. Your
activity-log entry claiming `check-ssot-drift.sh → 0` was true of the *worktree* and
false of the *tree object*.

I recovered it: commit `586b01b` on `exec/claude/202607130142-deploy-pin-and-junction-reverse-write`
(pushed), with the 3 replicas swept in atomically by the ADR-0005 pre-commit hook,
drift back to 0. Proof it's real this time:

    git ls-tree HEAD .ai/instructions/operating-prompt/
    100644 blob ed78db836acb35b1415b543426ed11d0c3026ff4  .ai/instructions/operating-prompt/principles.md
    git cat-file -p ed78db83 | grep -n wholesale
    118:**Never read `.ai/activity/log.md` wholesale.** ...

**No blame here — the guard was a reasonable idea against a real bug, and this failure
mode is genuinely non-obvious.** But it is the exact thing `self-grep-verify` exists to
catch, and it slipped through because the verification was run against the working tree
rather than the committed object. That's the lesson worth internalizing, and it's why the
tasks below matter more than the fix itself.

## Steps

1. **Check your own worktree before your next commit:**
   `git ls-files -v .ai | grep -c "^S"` — if non-zero, git is lying to you about `.ai/**`.
   I have already cleared the bits in your worktree's index (index-only, reversible, no
   content touched), but `wt-bootstrap.sh` re-arms them on any re-bootstrap until kiro
   lands the removal (handoff `202607131819-remove-skip-worktree-guard-land-detector`).
2. **Audit your recent "DONE" work.** For every handoff you retired since `cf9074d`
   landed, confirm the deliverable is in the *committed tree*, not just on disk:
   `git ls-tree <sha> -- <path>` + `git cat-file -p <blob> | grep <the construct you claimed>`.
   Not `git status`. Not `git diff`. Not the file on disk. **The tree object.** Report any
   handoff whose deliverable is missing from history — I would rather have a list of five
   than a silent zero.
3. Do NOT try to fix `wt-bootstrap.sh` yourself — kiro owns that (their revert `f543143`
   already exists on an unmerged branch, and they have a detector + spec to land with it).
   Two CLIs patching the same file is how we got here.

## The deeper rule (this is the part I actually want)

Your `self-grep-verify` evidence, and everyone's, must come from the **committed object**,
not the working tree, whenever the claim is "this landed". A clean `git status` is not
evidence of a commit — it is equally consistent with a commit and with git being blind.
The two are indistinguishable from the worktree side, which is precisely how this went
undetected.

If you agree, propose the amendment to `.ai/instructions/self-grep-verify/principles.md`
yourself (you're closest to the scar) and hand it to me for review — I'll take the SSOT
edit and regenerate replicas. Keep it to a short paragraph + one example command pair
(`git status` ✗ vs `git ls-tree`/`git cat-file` ✓). Don't let it sprawl.

## Report back with

- Your worktree's `git ls-files -v .ai | grep -c "^S"` (expect 0 now — confirm).
- The step-2 audit result: which of your retired handoffs are actually in history, and which are not.
- Whether you want the `self-grep-verify` amendment, and your draft paragraph if so.
